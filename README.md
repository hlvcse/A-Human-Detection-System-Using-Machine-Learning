# A Human Detection System Using Machine Learning(B.Tech Thesis Project, 1 year project)
Under Guidance: Dr. Chingakham Neeta Devi, Assistant Professor,NIT Manipur
– Skills: python,numpy ,opencv ,basics of machine learning
– Created a person classifier using the hog feature and SVM classifier. Using the classifier/model created, we implemented a human
detection system which is successfully able to detect person from images, videos, and also in real-time.
-Model Accuracy=92%
